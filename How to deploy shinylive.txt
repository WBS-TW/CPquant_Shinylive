Some tutorial for deploying shinylive in github:
https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/RShiny/lessons/shinylive.html
https://github.com/RamiKrispin/shinylive-r

Creation of this serverless github pages was made using the following steps from the above tutorials:

library(shinylive)
library(httpuv)
shinylive::export(appdir = "D:/R_projects/CPquant_Shinylive/", destdir = "docs")
where ..FULLPATH is the path in the local computer

httpuv::runStaticServer("docs/", port = 8008)
